"""Every route must use an HTTP verb the AppAPI proxy can actually forward.

AppAPI publishes proxy handlers for GET, POST, PUT and DELETE only
(ExAppProxy#ExAppGet/Post/Put/Delete in app_api/appinfo/routes.php). A PATCH
to /apps/app_api/proxy/citizens/... is answered 405 by Nextcloud's own router:
it never reaches this app, and our <routes> table is never consulted.

Finding review (Approve/Reject) shipped broken for exactly that reason, and the
rest of the suite cannot see this class of bug — TestClient talks to FastAPI
directly, so it bypasses the proxy that does the rejecting.

Routes come from app.openapi() rather than app.routes: since FastAPI 0.141
app.routes holds unexpanded _IncludedRouter placeholders, so walking it finds
no endpoints at all and every assertion here would pass vacuously.
