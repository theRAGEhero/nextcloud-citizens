"""Provider config must never be read while a write transaction is open.

Reading provider config means an OCS HTTP call to Nextcloud. SQLite has one
writer, and `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` claims it at transaction start, so a config read
inside a transaction holds that slot across a network round-trip. Every request
that wants to write then queues on `busy_timeout` (10 s) and fails with
"database is locked" — a 500 to a phone mid-recording.

This has now happened three times: in the job handlers, then again in the
retention sweep, then on the chunk-upload path. Each time it was fixed with a
comment. This test is the version that cannot be forgotten.
