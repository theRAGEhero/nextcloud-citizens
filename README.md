# Citizens — deliberative assemblies in Nextcloud

[![License: AGPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-AGPL_v3-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

A Nextcloud [ExApp](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/developer_manual/exapp_development/index.html)
for running **in-person citizens' assemblies and deliberative workshops**: one
ordinary phone per discussion table records the conversation, and the app turns
those recordings into transcripts, per-table summaries and cross-table findings
that a human organizer reviews before anything is published.

> **Beta.** The pipeline is tested end to end. Audio retention is configurable,
> and the recorder tells each table what happens to the recording before it
> starts. That screen is not a per-individual consent record, so bring your own
> privacy notice, and rehearse before a high-stakes assembly.

## What it does

* **Offline-first recording.** Audio is written to the phone's storage before
  anything is uploaded, with checksums and idempotent retries, so a bad network
  can never lose a discussion.
* **Two ways to run an assembly.** *Live*: you start and end each round and every
  armed table records simultaneously. *Independent*: each table works through the
  same questions on its own schedule, even days apart.
* **Evidence-linked analysis.** Every finding cites the transcript passages that
  support it — speaker, timestamp, exact words. A finding with no evidence is
  discarded automatically.
* **Human-approved output.** AI findings are drafts until an organizer approves
  them; reports distinguish approved findings from AI summaries.
* **Institutional reports.** Branded PDF with an executive summary, points of
  consensus and divergence, and participation coverage — publishable back to the
  table phones so participants see their own outcome.
* **Data you control.** Per-assembly Files tab to download, export or delete
  audio and transcripts at any time — and with a self-hosted Whisper server or
  Vosk, recordings never leave your infrastructure at all.

## Install

Settings → Administration → **External Apps** → *Citizens* → Install.
Requires Nextcloud 32+ with AppAPI and a deploy daemon.

Then open **Citizens → Settings** to add a speech-to-text key and an analysis
endpoint. Until you do, the app records and stores audio but sends nothing
anywhere. See the [administration guide](docs/administration.md).

## What leaves your server

| Step | Data | Destination | Condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Transcription | assembled audio of a recording | Deepgram, Mistral, or any OpenAI-compatible Whisper endpoint — **or nothing at all**, with a self-hosted Whisper server or Vosk | only with an admin-configured engine |
| Analysis | transcript text (never audio) | any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, including your own | only with an admin-configured endpoint |

Everything else — audio, transcripts, findings, reports — stays in the app's own
storage on your server, never in users' Nextcloud files.
