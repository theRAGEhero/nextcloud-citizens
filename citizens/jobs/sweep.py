"""Periodic upkeep the reactive job queue cannot express.

The runner only acts when something enqueues work. A phone whose battery dies
mid-upload enqueues nothing, so its recording stayed in WAITING_FOR_CHUNKS
forever — and because that state counts as healthy-pending, the round's
cross-table analysis waited on it too. One dead phone wedged the whole round,
with no organizer action that could resolve it.

Sweeps are best-effort: a failure is logged and retried on the next tick, and
must never take a recording's audio with it.
