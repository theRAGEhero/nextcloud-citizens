"""Headers for file downloads.

Every download MUST send Cache-Control, because AppAPI's proxy adds its own
otherwise (ExAppProxyController::buildProxyResponse):

    if ($cache && !$isHTML && empty($response->getHeader('cache-control'))
        && Content-Type is not application/json ...) {
        $proxyResponse->cacheFor(3600);
    }

`cacheFor(3600)` sets `Cache-Control: private, max-age=3600`, so for an hour the
browser serves the file from its own cache without contacting the server. That
is wrong for every download here, and actively dangerous for one:
`/api/v1/public/recorder/report.pdf` is the same URL for every assembly — only
the bearer token distinguishes them, and no cache looks at headers — so a phone
used in two assemblies downloaded the first one's report for the next hour.

JSON is excluded from the proxy's rule, which is why the report *screen* was
right while the PDF was wrong.
